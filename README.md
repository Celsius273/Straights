CS247 Project 1 (with David Tae Sung Lee)

Project for CS247 course, by Kelvin Jiang and David Tae Sung Lee.

Using version control for obvious reasons.

Please clone into the directory where all c++ files are stored in Visual Studio for compatibility, or not (if your text editor skills are absolutely SUBLIME)

Log completed milestones and dates here too.

CS247 Project 2 (with David Tae Sung Lee)

Part 2 of project, we can definitely reuse a lot of our part 1 hopefully so as to not have to re-code the game logic.

Testing will be done on the SSH environment while the actual coding will be done on a slightly more user-friendly environment (like my pc)
